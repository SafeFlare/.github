SafeFlare is a mobile app built using flutter to help prevent the spread of wildfire before it causes a lot of destruction for the people around them. And it uses IOT technology to show an accurate data of a possible wildfire spread in order to properly warn the local about a potential wildfire.<br><br>

In line with SDG's number 3 (good health and well beings), 13 (climate action) and 15 (life on land). We hope to help prevent massive land destruction and unnecessary health risk caused by these wildfires.

## How do our app help?
Our app includes features to help combat wildfire, such as
- IOT integration to monitor wind direction, temperature and humidity to detect possible wildfire risk
- Report form to let the user report a wildfire before it spreads
- A map that shows the location of confirmed wildfire reports
- An "add device" option that lets the user contribute by registering their own IOT device to our system
- A warning that shows the user if there's a wildfire near their areas

## Next feature
- Working realtime notification system to warn the user if there's a confirmed wildfire reports near their area
- A system that can predict the wildfire in the future using machine learning algorithm
